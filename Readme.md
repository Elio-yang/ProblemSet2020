# Problem Set 2020-2021
This is a repo for daily exercise and some creative ideas based on the DataStructure I have been taking. There are some parts in this repo:\
1. ``.vscode`` this is my config folder for vscode
2. ``algo_notes`` some problem from some book
3. ``courses`` from the classes
4. ``homework`` as the word it self 

Mainly written by C/C++.
